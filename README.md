# Installation
## Windows
 - install mingw using "scoop install mingw"
 - install neovim using "scoop install neovim"
 - then go to your "~//../../AppData/Local/" directory and clone the repository
 - and finally rename that newly cloned repositories file name to "nvim"
 - now you should have "~//../../AppData/Local/nvim/"

 ## Arch Linux
 - install mingw using: "sudo pacman -S mingw", or for paru: "paru -S mingw"



 #Notes
 - I find that neovim works best with the Alacritty terminal emulator because it stutters less and does not lag as much when scrolling large files
